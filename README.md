MCTS implementation using UCT formula as heuristic search. A visualisation tool and a toy example are provided. To run the visualization tool the networkx / matplotlib packages are needed. The toy example used to assert that this implementation works fine is the Tictactoe with the standard rules. The MCTS.py wich contains the core of the algorithm is commented.
